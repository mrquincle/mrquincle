# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Feel free to contact me to learn things or teach me things. If you've a love for knowing how things truly work, we'll probably go along well.

## Ingy

As the CTO at Ingy I'm working with my team to conquer the light and control market with a Wirepas based solution. We've been building firmware for dozens of different manufacturers and have been building the full stack from embedded, gateway, app, to cloud.

If you're a firmware or cloud engineer feel free to connect me.

## Crownstone

ðŸ‘¯ As CEO I've worked with my team at Crownstone on an open-source switch/dimmer which is better then anything before! ðŸ˜„ Check it out at <https://crownstone.rocks>. Also check out the firmware itself, which is called [bluenet](https://github.com/crownstone/bluenet/).

## DoBots

We build the autopilot for an industrial autonomous cleaning robot. It works perfectly but the cleaning industry wasn't yet ready for performance-based contracts. One can win contracts with X janitors times their costs plus margin, or X - k janitors times their costs plus margin plus a bit for a robot. Guess what's the preference of the cleaning companies.
  
## Reverse engineering

:ninja: I've been working with computers since I was 10. It started with solving puzzles that I otherwise couldn't solve in a popular science magazine (called Kijk) using QBasic. I also played extensively with the hardware settings too (remember "extended memory"!). One time I broke my father's computer. At the computer shop they had difficulties to get it back in order. To my surprise my father was proud. I've been a tinkerer ever since. 

* Please, if I reverse engineer your hardware or report bugs in your software, don't shoot the messenger!
* I've seen so much software that is like "Swiss cheese" (in Dutch "gatenkaas") that I won't even get in contact. If I report, it's out of respect for the quality of your work.
* If you work in customer support, please address in your organisation the need for a standard procedure with respect to vulnerabilities. If you don't have the budget for a bug bounty program, respond fast, with respect for my time, and with respect for the responsible disclosure.

## Science

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™ve been working on nonparametric Bayesian methods for point clouds. Hopefully that will in the end result in some serendipitous insights in non-related math or algorithms.

Some other personal interests:

* Consensus algorithms (back from my days working on self-organizing wireless sensor networks). Gossiping algorithms, voting mechanisms, cognitive radio, etc.
* Autonomous robots (worked on evolutionary methods, in particular artificial gene regulatory networks, and sensor fusion).

Wants to learn more about:

* State-of-the-art blockchain technology, e.g. Substrate. Of course, tying into IoT would be fun.
* Deep learning (who not?), e.g. incorporating something temporal like polychronization (Izhikevich). Can we build something that has those beta, gamma, etc. waves? Don't even care if that behaviour is barely functional. 
* Homomorphic encryption. It's the future of privacy.

## Community

Wants to help build/create/foster companies that want to:

* Aid the **electrification** of particular difficult sectors/applications where it has nevertheless a large impact.
* Implement **wireless charging** at a distance of a couple of meters. Charging is (and cables are) the most important barrier to widespread adoption of chips in everything. Backscatter tech is awesome. Without this it's still the stone age.
* Grow **lab-grown meat**. Without the use of animals, meat is an excellent product. Same is true for fish, eggs, milk, butter, and cheese.
* Build **energy tech** at the physical periphery of Europe to foster the local economy and move the entire continent faster on the path of sustainability.
* Grow **sea farms**. Requires extensive robotization to make aquaculture economically efficient. Might also require getting sunlight into deeper sea levels. Big advantage is that the sea is 3D. It's a huge volume to grow crops in.
* Build **embodied artificial intelligent** systems (robots, self-driving cars, drones). We won't have enough hands in the future.
