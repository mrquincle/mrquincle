### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m working with my team at Crownstone on an open-source switch/dimmer which is better then anything before! ðŸ˜„ Check it out at <https://crownstone.rocks> and tell me what you think. Also check out the firmware itself, which is called [bluenet](https://github.com/crownstone/bluenet/).

ðŸ”­ Apart from that Iâ€™m working on nonparametric Bayesian methods for point clouds.
